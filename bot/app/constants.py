START_MESSAGE = "Hello! üòä This is a bot for checking the reliability of medicines. \
Overall evaluation of the drug based on the analysis of its presence in such sources as FDA, \
European Medicines Agency, PubMed, Drugs. com, RxList and WHO.\n \
Keep in mind that reliability does not mean that a drug is safe, has no side effects, or \
prescribed correctly. This means that it is likely to have a positive effect on the \
conditions described in the instructions. Meanwhile, unreliable drugs are most likely to have no effect at all.\n \
To get this information enter the international nonproprietary name (INN) or active pharmaceutical \
ingredient of the drug in English."
